Python image manipulation to mimic the implementation of image filters

This is a project I worked on approximately a month ago, I had taken a module in Image processing for my undergraduate degree and was interested in putting some of that knowledge into practice. I then had a look online for interesting python projects that implemented image processing techniques. I had found source code for the png.py and image.py files which was of great help and used a combination of guided tutorials and StackOverflow research to create the transform.py file. In this
code, I use Python to adjust the brightness and contrast, add blur, and detect
the edges of an image.

Here, you will find the following files:

- png.py: Python PNG `Reader` and `Writer` classes from Johann C. Rocholl
- image.py: This contains the `Image` class that reads and writes the images using the PNG `Writer` and `Reader`
- transform.py: Implemented image filter functions
- input folder: Here I have saved two image files ‘lake.png’ and ‘city.png’, these will be inputs/original images 
- output folder: Once the images have been manipulated they will be saved in the output folder
- project context word document: this gives you a brief overview, walks you through the code and highlights limitations and improvements
